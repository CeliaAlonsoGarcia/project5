Game project

I couldnt get the user choice to update so I did console.log to make sure the query slectors were working first of all and then the addEventlistener for click was working
then i realised there was a type when selecting the buttons

I declared if statement outside a function so it was being called when the page loaded

I wanted to change the words "rock, paper, scissors" for the emoji and i was struggling because I was targetting the id but then added the value to to the buttons to be the emoji and targetted the value instead.

At first i only targetted with value the computer generated because it's the only won that was not working but then the if statement didn't work so I charged to both computuergenerated and userchoice were being targetted by value and the if statement works


added delay to the generatecomputer choice an dresult and made them blank
